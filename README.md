# Pantents by Country for the Past Four Decades

It is the project of an animated visualization of the GDP per capita and the number of granted patents per country for the past four decades.

The data on patents comes from the [WIPO](https://www.wipo.int/portal/en/index.html), and the population and GDP numbers are from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/).
